\section{\-Class \-List}
\-Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBaseApplication}{\-Base\-Application} \\*\-Ogre \hyperlink{classBaseApplication}{\-Base\-Application} class \-The \hyperlink{classBaseApplication}{\-Base\-Application} class is the central class in the project. \-It brings all systems together\-: $\ast$initialization and control of the rendering process $\ast$handling keyboard/mouse input $\ast$connection to \-R\-O\-S for joystick input, image sensor data, waypoint data, etc. $\ast$cleaning up after the application finished }{\pageref{classBaseApplication}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classDoor}{\-Door} \\*\-Represents a \hyperlink{classDoor}{\-Door} in the demo-\/game. \-A door is a \hyperlink{classGameObject}{\-Game\-Object} and takes care of the appearance, as well as the behaviour of a door }{\pageref{classDoor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game} \\*\-Singleton pattern class to manage the demo-\/game. \-This class manages the demo-\/game and is responsible for all related objects, their (repeatable) initialization and the game process }{\pageref{classGame}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGameCFGParser}{\-Game\-C\-F\-G\-Parser} \\*\-Parses the 'game.\-cfg' file. \-This class provides an easy-\/to-\/use parser for the config file of a game. \-Note that the filename is hardcoded in the constructor }{\pageref{classGameCFGParser}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGameObject}{\-Game\-Object} \\*\-Describes a generic game object. \-This class is an abstract description of a game object. \-It give some default functionality and is otherwise used to inherit the properties to its child classes\-: \hyperlink{classDoor}{\-Door}, \hyperlink{classKey}{\-Key}, \hyperlink{classTreasure}{\-Treasure} and \hyperlink{classLock}{\-Lock} }{\pageref{classGameObject}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGlobalMap}{\-Global\-Map} \\*\-Utility class for the 2\-D map. \-This class handles the 2\-D map in the scene }{\pageref{classGlobalMap}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classKey}{\-Key} \\*\-Represents a \hyperlink{classKey}{\-Key} in a \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game}. \-This class is a more detailed description of the \hyperlink{classGameObject}{\-Game\-Object} \hyperlink{classKey}{\-Key}. \-It specifies how to display and what to do with a key }{\pageref{classKey}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classLock}{\-Lock} \\*\-Describes a \hyperlink{classLock}{\-Lock} in a \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game}. \-This class specifies the details to display a lock and implements its behaviour }{\pageref{classLock}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classOculus}{\-Oculus} \\*\-Handler for the \hyperlink{classOculus}{\-Oculus} \-Rift using \-S\-D\-K1. \-Written by \-Kojack 2013 (\-C). \-Slightly modified to take the \-Plaber\-Body scene node as parent to the camera setup }{\pageref{classOculus}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classPlayerBody}{\-Player\-Body} \\*\-Handles the \hyperlink{classPlayerBody}{\-Player\-Body} motion. \-Extension class to handle the player motion independent from the \hyperlink{classOculus}{\-Oculus} \-Rift head motion. \-The \hyperlink{classOculus}{\-Oculus} motion happens on top of this, which is achieved by making the \hyperlink{classPlayerBody}{\-Player\-Body}'s scene node the parent for the \hyperlink{classOculus}{\-Oculus} handler. \-Since this was one of my first implementations (very unclean) this step, in fact, happens in \hyperlink{classBaseApplication}{\-Base\-Application} }{\pageref{classPlayerBody}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classRobot}{\-Robot} \\*\-Represents a \hyperlink{classRobot}{\-Robot}. \-This class handles the robot avatar }{\pageref{classRobot}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classRoculus}{\-Roculus} \\*\-Class to take care of the scene and object creation. \-This class fills the scene with objects and in most cases creates the geometries manually. \-It has a method to parse room recordings in folders in order to include them into the scene. \-Though it is the nominal main class, the majority of the implementation is found in the \hyperlink{classBaseApplication}{\-Base\-Application} class }{\pageref{classRoculus}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classRoom}{\-Room} \\*\-Describes a \hyperlink{classRoom}{\-Room} in a \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game}. \-This class collects all parameters for a \hyperlink{classRoom}{\-Room}. \-It keeps track of the corresponding \-Way\-Points, \hyperlink{classDoor}{\-Door} nodes and event nodes and provides some utility functions }{\pageref{classRoom}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classSnapshot}{\-Snapshot} \\*\-Collects all data that describes a \hyperlink{classSnapshot}{\-Snapshot} and provides a method to insert it into the scene. (\-Not the smartest implementation, should probably be constructed given the scene manager and do the object creation by itself. \-Static counter would help to identify total number of \-Snapshots to link to individual materials, textures etc.) }{\pageref{classSnapshot}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classSnapshotLibrary}{\-Snapshot\-Library} \\*\-Groups multiple \-Snapshots in a library (vector). \-Furthermore, this class manages the memory and preallocates \-Ogre\-::\-Textures, \-Materials and \-Scene\-Nodes, whenever needed }{\pageref{classSnapshotLibrary}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classTreasure}{\-Treasure} \\*\-Describes the appearance and behaviour of a \hyperlink{classTreasure}{\-Treasure} in the \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game}. \-This class is similar to the other \-Game\-Objects }{\pageref{classTreasure}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classVideo3D}{\-Video3\-D} \\*\-Handles the 3\-D video stream. \-Similar to a \hyperlink{classSnapshot}{\-Snapshot}, but uses \-D\-Y\-N\-A\-M\-I\-C and \-D\-I\-S\-C\-A\-R\-D\-A\-B\-L\-E textures instead, which are updated, not placed. (\-Not the smartest implementation, should probably be inherit properties from \hyperlink{classSnapshot}{\-Snapshot}...) }{\pageref{classVideo3D}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classWayPoint}{\-Way\-Point} \\*\-Defines a \hyperlink{classWayPoint}{\-Way\-Point} for the \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game}. \-Waypoints are possible navigation targets and are used to place \-Game\-Objects, like \-Keys and \-Locks. \-The list of \-Way\-Points is held by the \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game} class, but they are read from other classes quite often, usually passed as a pointer or reference. \-A \hyperlink{classWayPoint}{\-Way\-Point} can be made inaccessible for the selection by the player setting the accessible flag }{\pageref{classWayPoint}}{}
