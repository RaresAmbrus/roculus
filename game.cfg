# Using the OgreConfigFile standard

# Define the Game using the parameters:
# - cntCorridors = How many corridor areas do you have? (areas where no KEYS, TREASURES and DOORS may be placed, always accessible)
# - cntRooms = How many rooms are there? (rooms have a door, a door-event, a list of waypoints of which several should be ignored for the game)
# - cntWayPoint = How many WayPoints are in the world?
[Game]
cntCorridors = 1
cntRooms = 5
cntWayPoints = 24

# Define several corridors, the name has to be "CorridorXY", where XY is an increasing index
# Each corridor has a number of WPs (WayPoints)
[Corridor0]
WPs = 0 7 6 2 8 1 11 13 14 17 20 21 22

# Similar to corridors, but in addition to the WPs, you need to set:
# - WPs to use = each WP that may be used in the game as KEY or TREASURE
# - Door = the WP that will be the door
# - DoorEvt = the WP that is responsible to check the game state in order to open the door during the game
