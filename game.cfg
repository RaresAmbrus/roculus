# Using the OgreConfigFile standard

# Define the Game using the parameters:
# - initWP = The wayPoint, where the game should be started at (NOT a WPsUse node)
# - cntKeys = the number of Keys in the game
# - cntCorridors = How many corridor areas do you have? (areas where no KEYS, TREASURES and DOORS may be placed, always accessible)
# - cntRooms = How many rooms are there? (rooms have a door, a door-event, a list of waypoints of which several should be ignored for the game)
# - cntWayPoint = How many WayPoints are in the world?
[Game]
initWP = 18
cntKeys = 2
cntCorridors = 1
cntRooms = 6

# Define several corridors, the name has to be "CorridorXY", where XY is an increasing index
# Each corridor has a number of WPs (WayPoints)
[Corridor0]
WPs = 0 7 6 2 8 1 11 13 14 17 20

# Similar to corridors, but in addition to the WPs, you need to set:
# - Make sure the numbers go from 0 to cntRooms-1
# - WPs to use = each WP that may be used in the game as KEY or TREASURE, must NOT be empty
# - Door = the WP that will be the door
# - DoorEvt = the WP that is responsible to check the game state in order to open the door during the game
# IMPORTANT: note that the DoorEvt must NOT be part of the room
